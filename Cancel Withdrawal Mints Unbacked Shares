```solidity
    function cancelWithdrawal(address withdrawer) external onlyManager {
        uint256 currentEpoch = withdrawalEpoch;

        PendingWithdrawal memory currentPendingWithdrawal = queuedWithdrawal[withdrawer][
            currentEpoch
        ];

        queuedWithdrawal[withdrawer][currentEpoch] = PendingWithdrawal({amount: 0, basis: 0});
        userBasis[withdrawer] += currentPendingWithdrawal.basis;

        withdrawalEpochState[currentEpoch].sharesWithdrawn -= currentPendingWithdrawal.amount;

            //This part 
        _mintVirtual(withdrawer, currentPendingWithdrawal.amount);

        emit WithdrawalCancelled(withdrawer, currentPendingWithdrawal.amount);
    }

```


There is no check to ensure the original withdrawal was backed by assets.

There is no asset accounting reversal during cancellation.

The function assumes the vault still holds the assets â€” which may not be true
